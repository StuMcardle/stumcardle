### 👋 A little bit about me

A full-stack junior software engineer specialising in the front-end. My background combines creativity with a good level of technical knowledge and I love bringing these traits into my coding. I have become hugely passionate about writing code that is clean, tested and reusable.

Having recently completed the intensive 12 weeks of [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy), I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer.

I am currently looking to pursue my career in tech, where I can further expand my knowledge in Full-Stack and Front-End development and design.

### <a name="skills">🤹 Skills</a>

- **Quick Study** - Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently. I actively sought out challenges during the Makers Academy course, including producing our two week final project in React and Next.js with no prior experience.
- **Adaptable** - New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. None of these are a problem, only opportunities. I have worked in many sectors, in many countires and with a wide range of teams. There is always a way to connect.
- **Creative** - As a self-taught graphic designer and wordpress web designer, I have learned to be creative with my problem-solving and try to look sideways when something seems intractable.
- **Inquisitive** - I love learning and Makers Academy has only made me more committed to exploring development and code craftsmanship.
- **Attention to detail** - With my own projects, from design to UX, I have developed an extremely keen eye for the fine details. This comes through in my coding, from seeing how the whole code fits together to finding that one tiny bug.
- **Enthusiastic** - I am highly motivated, and unafraid of challenge. I do not shy away from difficult or time-consuming tasks.
- **Team-player** - Always comfortable finding my place in a team, whether that calls for knuckling down and getting my hands dirty or offering leadership when the situation arises.
- **Commitment** - I completed the 3 months of Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a remote student. This required discipline and focus – with a considerable helping of self-belief.
